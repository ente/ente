# Wasm bindings for Rust code

## [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen)

A Rust library that provides the `#[wasm_bindgen]` attribute macro. When you annotate a function with `#[wasm_bindgen]`, it:

1. Marks the function for export to JavaScript
2. Handles type conversions between Rust and JS (e.g., `String` ↔ JS string, `i64` ↔ `BigInt`)
3. Generates metadata that the wasm-bindgen CLI uses to create JS/TS glue code

## [wasm-pack](https://github.com/wasm-bindgen/wasm-pack)

A CLI tool that orchestrates the WASM build process:

1. Runs `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`
2. Invokes `wasm-bindgen` CLI to generate JS/TS bindings from the compiled WASM
3. Outputs everything to a `pkg/` directory ready for npm/bundlers

wasm-pack is installed via npm as a devDependency, so `npm ci` handles it.
